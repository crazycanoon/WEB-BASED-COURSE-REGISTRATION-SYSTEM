					Data Science
				</h1><sup>Duration : 8 Weeks</sup>
			    
				
				<p class="text-small">
					Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), 
					and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organizationâ€™s data.
					These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.<br><br>
					In today's world, we use Data Science to find patterns in data, and make meaningful, 
					data driven conclusions and predictions.  <br><br>
					This course is for everyone, and teaches concepts like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, 
					and Neural Networks and how companies apply data science in business.  <br>

					Machine Learning
				</h1>
				<sup>Duration : 6 Weeks</sup>
				<p class="text-small">
					Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on 
					the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.<br><br>
					Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. 
					Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, 
					uncovering key insights within data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. 
					As big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists will increase, 
					requiring them to assist in the identification of the most relevant business questions and subsequently the data to answer them.

				Artificial Intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. 
				The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.<br><br>
				At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. 
				It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. 
				These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications based on input data.
